- Express.js Request and Response objects are the parameters of the callback function which is used in Express applications.<br /><br />
- The **express.js request object (req)** represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on.<br /><br />
- The **response object (res)** specifies the HTTP response which is sent by an Express app when it gets an HTTP request.<br /><br />
You can print req and res objects which provide a lot of information related to HTTP request and response including cookies, sessions, URL, etc.<br />

## Request Object

**Syntax**
```javascript
app.get(‘/’, function (req, res) { })  
```

In thie Topic 1, we have seen a basic application which serves HTTP request for the homepage. <br />
Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).


Now, let's code to a program to handle more types of HTTP requests.

### Code
```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
   console.log("Got a GET request for the homepage");
   res.send('Hello GET');
})

app.post('/', function (req, res) {
   console.log("Got a POST request for the homepage");
   res.send('Hello POST');
})

app.delete('/del_user', function (req, res) {
   console.log("Got a DELETE request for /del_user");
   res.send('Hello DELETE');
})

app.get('/list_user', function (req, res) {
   console.log("Got a GET request for /list_user");
   res.send('Page Listing');
})

app.get('/ab*cd', function(req, res) {   
   console.log("Got a GET request for /ab*cd");
   res.send('Page Pattern Match');
})

var server = app.listen(8081, function () {
   var host = server.address().address
   var port = server.address().port
   
   console.log("Example app listening at http://%s:%s", host, port)
})
```

```
node server.js
```

You will see following output -
```
Example app listening at http://:::8081
```

Now you can try different requests at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to see the output generated by server.js. For example. [http://localhost:8081/list_user](http://localhost:8081/list_user), [http://localhost:8081/del_user](http://localhost:8081/del_user), [http://localhost:8081/abcd](http://localhost:8081/abcd), [http://localhost:8081/ab123cd](http://localhost:8081/ab123cd), etc.

### File Uploader Form
Let's try to make a file uploader form. (You can see code in Code Folder. Here's the [link]())

### Cookies Management
You can send cookies to a Node.js server which can handle the same using the following middleware option. Following is a simple example to print all the cookies sent by the client.

```javascript
var express      = require('express')
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser')

var app = express()
app.use(cookieParser())

app.get('/', function(req, res) {
   console.log("Cookies: ", req.cookies)
})
app.listen(8081)
```
