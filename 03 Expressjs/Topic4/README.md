**HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource.**<br/>
Here, are the most common methods - <br />
| S.No | Method & Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | **GET**<br /> The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect.**                                                    |
| 2    | **POST**<br/> The POST method requests that the server accept the data enclosed in the request as a new object/entity of the resource identified by the URI.                                                         |
| 3    | **PUT**<br/> The PUT method requests that the server accept the data enclosed in the request as a modification to existing object identified by the URI. If it does not exist then the PUT method should create one. |
| 4    | **DELETE**<br /> The DELETE method requests that the server delete the specified resource                                                                                                                            |

### To put it in short...
Create - Post<br />
Read - Get<br />
Update - Put<br />
Delete - Delete<br />

Now consider we are making a student based application then using following statements we will perform different applications -
```javascript
    // Create a new Student
    app.post('/api/students', students.create);
 
    // Retrieve all Customer
    app.get('/api/students', students.findAll);
 
    // Retrieve a single Student by Id
    app.get('/api/students/:id', students.findOne);
 
    // Update a Student with Id
    app.put('/api/student/:id', student.update);
 
    // Delete a Student with Id
    app.delete('/api/students/:id', student.delete);
```

## Let's try to build a to-do list application
[üìÅ](https://github.com/iampavangandhi/TheNodeCourse/tree/master/03%20Expressjs/Topic4/Code)  
<p> To run application </p>

<ol>
<li> Run <code> npm install </code> to install all needed dependencies </li>

<li> Then start the server using <code> node index.js </code> </li>

<li> Navigate to your browser <code> http://localhost:3000/ </code> to view the app </li>
</ol>
