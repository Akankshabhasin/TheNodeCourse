## MongoDB Introduction

MongoDB is a NoSQL database. There are different types of NoSQL databases, so to be specific MongoDB is an open source document based NoSQL database.

### What is a NoSQL database?

NoSQL databases are different than relational databases like MQSql. In relational database you need to create the table, define schema, set the data types of fields etc before you can actually insert the data. In NoSQL you donâ€™t have to worry about that, you can insert, update data on the fly.

One of the advantage of NoSQL database is that they are really easy to scale and they are much faster in most types of operations that we perform on database. There are certain situations where you would prefer relational database over NoSQL, however when you are dealing with huge amount of data then NoSQL database is your best choice.

### What are the advantages of NoSQL

The main advantages are high scalability and high availability.

- High scalability
- High Availability

### When to go for NoSQL

When you would want to choose NoSQL over relational database:

- When you want to store and retrieve huge amount of data.
- The relationship between the data you store is not that important
- The data is not structured and changing over time
- Constraints and Joins support is not required at database level
- The data is growing continuously and you need to scale the database regular to handle the data.
